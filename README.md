## Java Tree-walker implementation of the Lox language

This is a repository for the code developed as a project throughout Crafting Interpreters.

The main class, Lox.java, can be run without arguments to run in interpreter mode. Alternatively, run Lox.java with a filepath to a text source file to compile it and run it.
